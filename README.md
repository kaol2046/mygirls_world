Website URL: http://mygirls.world. A website that generates AI-generated beautiful girl images using stable-diffusion, powered by the free computational network of SDCN (https://www.sdcn.info/). Welcome to exchange ideas and the code is continuously updated.

There are two folders in the project (api, www). The api part of this project uses FastAPI (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and the frontend of www uses the VUE framework.
